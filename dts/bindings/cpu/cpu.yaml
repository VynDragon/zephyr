properties:
    timebase-frequency:
      type: int
      required: false
      description: |
        A cell indicating the frequency of the timebase in Hz. This is not
        directly used by the generic code, but you are welcome to copy/paste
        the pSeries code for setting the kernel timebase/decrementer
        calibration based on this value.
    clock-frequency:
      type: int
      required: false
      description: |
        A cell indicating the CPU core clock frequency in Hz. A new property
        will be defined for 64-bit values, but if your frequency is < 4Ghz,
        one cell is enough. Here as well as for the above, the common code
        doesn't use that property, but you are welcome to re-use the pSeries
        or Maple one. A future kernel version might provide a common function
        for this.
    cpu-power-states:
      type: phandles
      required: false
      description: |
        List of power management states supported by this cpu
    i-cache-line-size:
      type: int
      required: false
      description: |
        One cell, L1 data cache line size in bytes if different from the
        block size.
    d-cache-line-size:
      type: int
      required: false
      description: |
        One cell, L1 instruction cache line size in bytes if different from
        the block size.
